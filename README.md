# ClipCap Evolved
### _work-in-progress_

Requires installation of packages listed in _requirements.txt_ file and Python 3.

Dataset (COCO 2017) should be unpacked into any directory, and paths to image directories and annotation files should be specified with proper arguments when executing the script.

Training is done by executing _train.py_ and specifying proper arguments. List of arguments can be obtained with _python train.py --help_.

Project relies on _wandb_ so the user should log in the first time they execute the script, or --offline flag should be specified. _(it may be required to change the entity inside the train.py script to own username)_
